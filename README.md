# WaitBot-To replace waiters at restaurants

Followed rule based approach of questions
- Made buttons for different questions
- Made the chatbot work for sending images as response/answer
- Added option for accepting queries from the user and validating the email id. 
- Generating a token for the query, if the email is valid

Menu/button-based chatbots are glorified decision tree hierarchies presented to the user in the form of buttons. Similar to the automated phone menus we all interact with on almost a daily basis, these chatbots require the user to make several selections to dig deeper towards the ultimate answer.

While these chatbots are sufficient for answering that handful of nagging FAQs that make up 80% of support queries; they fall well short in more advanced scenarios in which there are too many variables or too much knowledge at play to predict how users should get to specific answers with confidence. 

This approach was chosen as there wasnâ€™t a dataset to start with.
